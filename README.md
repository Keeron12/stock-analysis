# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project the challenge was to refactor the given code and calculate the return and daily volume of the given stocks of 2017 and 2018.

### Purpose
The purpose of refactoring the code was to make the code run faster and make the code easier to read for future users. The purpose for calculating the return and daily volume for the given stocks would be to determine which stocks would be best to invest in.

### Analysis
Looking at "VBA 2017" vs "All Stocks 2017" the time to finish running the code for "VBA 2017" was faster than the "All Stocks 2017." Looking at "VBA 2018" vs "All Stocks 2018" the time to finish running the code for "VBA 2018" was slower than the "All Stocks 2018."
From first look it might seem that refactoring the code did not speed up the process overall, but it could be when I chose to run the program. I ran the the "VBA 2017" right before I did the screenshot to make sure the program worked. Then I ran it again to take the screenshot, so the program was already geared before hand in the computer. When I ran the "VBA 2018" I took the screenshot of the first run through. I believe since I did "All Stocks 2018" right after the "VBA 2018" and the code is similar, that could be the reason that "All Stocks 2018" time was faster.

Comparing the returns from 2017 and 2018 it can be seen that 2017 had a greater return for all the stocks except TERP. Although TERP was still negative in 2018(-5%), it was not as negative as it was the in 2017(-7.21%). A few notiables is that ENPH and RUN still had a positive return in 2018. It is only two years of data, but with further research it could show a positive trend for these two companies and potentially be worth investing in. Another noteable factor is that the total daily volume was significantly higher for all the stocks except AY, SPWR, FSLR, JKS. I do not believe there is a correlation of return vs volume based off these charts. It is noteable that these companies did have some of the worst returns for 2018 with decrease volume.

## Summary
Based off the anaylsis I believe that refactoring the code can be useful. It helps to make the code more readable for cases where you would come back and have to debug, and would need to understand what you were doing the first time around. Also I believe continuos improvement and developement would help the code run faster and be more efficient, and this can be achieved through refactoring. One con I can think of right now is the time consumption of going through and reading every line of code and seeing how it can be improved. If the code does the job you can spend time working on something more important or a project that requires more attention.
